## Getting Started

This is re-implementation of [Flutter Todo app](https://github.com/tuannguyendotme/flutter_todo) but using BLOC instead of ScopedModel.

Features:

- Create/edit todo
- Delete todo by swipping
- Mark done/not done in list
- Filter todo list by status (all/done/not done)
- Change theme (light to dark and vice versa) at runtime
- Login/logout
- Register new account

![Dark List](dark_list.png?raw=true)
![Dark Editor](dark_editor.png?raw=true)

To get start, run below command in Terminal

```
cp .env.example.dart .env.dart
```

then add Firebase database's URL and API key to .env.dart.
